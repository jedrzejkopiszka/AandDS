    "\n",
    "When it comes to performance - the biggest difference is in accessing or iterating through the representation when checking if a specific pair of vertices is already an edge. Edge list is accessed linearly meaning each time we need to go through the whole list to find if the list contains that pair. In neighborhood matrix, we can access specific pair by [i][j]==1 or [i][j]==0. That is much faster, especially works much better in generating random graphs which is done partially by looking for a pair that does not have an edge."

    "Finding Euler cycle: For finding Euler circuit I used Fleury's Algorithm. The idea behind the algorithm is straightforward: start in selected vertex, next repeat: add \"u\" to the solution, select [u,v] and remove it (do not remove bridge if possible). I have chosen this algorithm mainly because of easy-to-understand steps, simple implementation. The downside of this algorithm is it's high running time - O(|E|^2) (we can improve it by using advanced Thorup algorithm - then O(|E|(log|E|^3) ). Another idea is to use Hierholzer's algorithm - O(|E|)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Hamilton cycle: I used a backtracking approach. It's idea is to start from any vertex, we make selected vertex a root of the constructed tree. Then we select the next vertex. When selected vertex makes a cycle with any vertex other than root we reach the maximum step. We must backtrack one step, and start the search once again by selecting another vertex and backtrack and remove the successful path. Such approach can give us polynomial time complexity for the NP-hard problem."
